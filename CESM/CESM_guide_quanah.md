# Background information

The Community Earth System Model (ESM) is a model for simulating coupled and
uncoupled Earth system components, such as land, atmosphere, and ocean.

Basic documentation about the CESM can be found at
[http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/).

This documentation will cover cloning and running the land component of the CESM,
that is the Community Land Model (CLM). Documentation on the CLM can be found at 
[http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/land/](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/land/).
